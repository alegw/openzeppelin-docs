This is a step-by-step guide for software developers who want to start writing
decentralized applications for the Ethereum Virtual Machine.

## Smart Contracts 101

We know you're eager to begin, but really do take some time to master the
fundamentals. Start at the [cryptocurrency basics](cryptocurrency-basics.md)
until you can comfortably answer:

- what public and private keys are
- why a blockchain needs miners
- how decentralized consensus is reached

Then move on to the quick [Ethereum basics](ethereum-basics.md)
section. After these two primers, you can get hands-on with the code and deploy
your first smart contract in under an hour.

Be sure to read [smart contract security references](http://consensys.github.io/smart-contract-best-practices/),
because smart contract security [is hard](https://twitter.com/lopp/status/989151422800330754).

0. [Cryptocurrency basics](cryptocurrency-basics.md) links to the bare minimum you should know about Bitcoin and blockchains.
1. [Ethereum basics](ethereum-basics.md) explains the Ethereum Virtual Machine, gas, transactions, and other concepts related to this blockchain.
2. [Setting up your test environment](test-environment.md) introduces `ganache-cli` and Truffle.
3. [Writing your first contract](first-contract.md) gets you to code, interact with, and deploy Proof Of Existence, a neat application of smart contracts.
4. [Writing a secure contract](secure-contract.md) teaches you how vulnerabilities can easily creep in your code.
5. [Using web3](using-web3.md) walks you through interacting with Ethereum smart contracts from a web app.
